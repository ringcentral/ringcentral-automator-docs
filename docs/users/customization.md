# Converting templates to custom workflows

Any workflow created from a template can be converted to an "advanced workflow." Advanced workflows are edited using a visual drag-and-drop design tool. They give users complete control over the workflow, allowing them to modify the logic of a workflow at a more fundamental level.

To convert a workflow to an advanced workflow, follow these steps:

1. Find the workflow in your list of workflows. 
2. Disable the workflow. 
3. From the more menu associated with that workflow, select "Convert to custom workflow."

<figure markdown>
  ![Converting a workflow to a custom workflow](../img/convert-to-advanced.png){ style="max-width: 400px" }
  <figcaption>Start with a template, and then customize it to meet your specific needs</figcaption>
</figure>

Doing the above will take you to the workflow designer for that workflow. If you make any changes to the workflow and save them, you will be unable to revert the workflow to a simple template.

While users do not need to know how to program in order to edit an advanced workflow, they do require users to be comfortable with simple concepts, such as:

* Controlling the flow of a workflow using conditionals
* Specifying when workflows should run by customizing the workflow's triggering event
* Chaining actions together to perform desired operations
