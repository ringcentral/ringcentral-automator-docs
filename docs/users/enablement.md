# Enabling and disabling workflows

As soon as a workflow is created you will be prompted to enable the workflow. Once the workflow is enabled, it will begin receiving and responding to events that trigger its execution. 

Being able to quickly toggle a workflow on and off allows you to preserve the workflow without deleting it so that you can better manage it without necessarily deleting the underlying logic. 

Bear in mind, workflows **must be disabled in order to be edited**. Therefore, while you are editing a workflow, the workflow will not be responding to events. 

!!! tip "If you find that you are unable to enable a custom workflow using the drag-and-drop editor, make sure there are no blank/empty nodes within the workflow. This can happen when you add a conditional node, but not all conditions result in an action being processed."
