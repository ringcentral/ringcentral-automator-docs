# Limiting the frequency of workflows

There are a number of scenarios in which one would like to limit how frequently a workflow is run. Consider the circumstance where one is on vacatation and has set up an auto-response saying, "I am on PTO and will reply to your message on [insert date]." Let's then say a customer begins texting them multitple times. They may only want to reply once per day to tell them that they are on PTO. That will help me save money, as every SMS message sent may come with a small cost, and it keeps the conversation with the customer clean.

To limit workflows in this way, to control how often they are run in response to a given event, look for the following option found by editing a workflow, or by editing the trigger associated with a custom workflow.

Any limit you set will apply within the context of a given individual you are communicating with. For example, you can limit a workflow to run once per day per *phone number*. This means that if multiple people are texting you from multiple phone numbers, they will each receive your autoreply only once per day.
