## Testing and simulating workflows

To assist users in producing workflows that they are confident will address their needs and use cases in all their various forms, Workflow Builder allows users to test the workflow by simulating a triggering event. 

To test a workflow, click the "Test" or "Save and test" buttons when editing the workflow. You will then be prompted with a form that lists all the variables within the workflow that can impact the workflow's execution. Fill out this form, and click "Simulate" to see a summarization of the simulation, and to see what logical path the workflow followed.
