# Let customers know that you don't respond to SMS messages

This recipe is a great example of a workflow that responds to all incoming messages. In this particular use case, the intention is to reply to all incoming SMS messages in order to let the sender of the SMS message know that your company does not accept and/or reply to SMS messages, and to instruct them to call a phone number instead. 

Technically, this workflow could be used to reply to all incoming SMS messages with an arbitrary message of your choice. This is because at its core this workflow is simply and without much discrimination, replies to all incoming SMS messages with the same static message.
