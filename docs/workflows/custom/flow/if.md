# Flow control: if

Workflow Builder's primary conditional node is a simple true/false, or boolean pathway. When this is added to your workflow, two different pathways are established:

* One is when the conditions of the node are met (the "true" branch)
* One is when the conditions are NOT met (the "false" branch)
