### Call missed

This event is fired when a call comes into an extension, but is never answered or picked up. 

* Voicemail-only extensions do not fire the missed call event, because no call that comes into a voicemail extension is ever missed - they are instantly picked up and a voicemail message is played. 
* Call queues fire the missed call event when a user hangs up while waiting for someone to answer. 
* Some call queues are configured to transfer unanswered calls to another extension, like a voicemail box. If this is the case for you, then the missed call event will not be fired for these calls.
