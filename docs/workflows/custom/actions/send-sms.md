Sends text via SMS from one phone number, to another phone number. When using the "Send SMS" action, please bear in mind the following:

* sending SMS via the RingCentral platform may incur additional costs depending upon your license
* sending an SMS does not guarantee that an SMS message will be delivered, especially if the receiving phone number is incapable of receiving an SMS, e.g. a fax machine
* one's ability to send an SMS depends upon the workflow's owner being assigned a phone number from which SMS are allowed to be sent
* one's ability to send an SMS depends upon an administrator setting up their account properly to send SMS after having gone through the TCR process of registering campaigns and so forth
