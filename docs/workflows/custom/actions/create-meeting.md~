<details id="create-meeting">
  <summary>Create meeting</summary>

Creates a meeting bridge in which a meeting can take place. 

You may notice that you do not need to provide a date and time in order to create a meeting. That is because RingCentral delegates the schedule of a meeting exclusively to the calendaring system in which a meeting URL is inserted. Therefore, all this action will do is generate a room in which a meeting will occur, and provide that URL to you as output so that you can transmit to a person or external system.

**Input**

* **Meeting name**. The name of the meeting.  
* **Meeting password**. The password required to access the meeting. 
* **Participants can only join after me**. An option to not start the meeting until the host arrives. 
* **Enable waiting room for**. An option to determine whom will be placed in a waiting room prior to the start of the meeting.

**Output**

* **Meeting link**. The meeting bridge's fully-formed join URL.
