    Workflow Builder is currently available to all RingCentral customers in the **United States**. We plan to expand access to other geographies and countries in June 2025. If you are an AT&T Office@Hand customer, or live outside the United States you are free to use Workflow Builder's predecessor [Automator](https://automator.labs.ringcentral.com/) in the meantime.

Welcome to RingCentral's Workflow Builder, a no-code workflow design tool created to help RingCentral customers automate common tasks using templated and custom workflows.

## Getting started using Workflow Builder

The fastest way to get started using RingCentral's Workflow Builder is to select a workflow from a list of pre-packaged, pre-designed workflow templates. Workflow templates make implementing a workflow as simple as filling out a form. 

To create a workflow, click the "New workflow" button found in the upper-right corner of the workflow listing screen. You will then be presented with a number of templates to choose from, the most popular being:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [__Out-of-office auto-reply__](workflows/templates/ooo-autoreplies.md)
  
    Reply to an SMS when you are out of the office, on vacation or away.

- [__After-hours auto-reply__](workflows/templates/after-hours.md) 

    Let people know that you missed their call because they called during non-business hours.

## Workflow Builder: a NO-code automation tool

The greatest advantage of Workflow Builder is that it is generally accessible and usable to everyone. Workflow Builder helps to democratize the RingCentral Developer Platform by allowing NON-developers and developers alike to build and deploy simple applications to perform repeatable tasks. 

Even if you don't know how to code, or even if the thought of "code" gives you hives, anyone can create a workflow using a ready-made template.

## Workflow Builder: a LOW-code developer tool

For those more comfortable with basic technical concepts, like if-statements, variables and actions, Workflow Builder provides users with a simple drag-and-drop workflow design tool to make building apps quick and easy. You do not need to know a programming language, and with a little time, literally anyone can learn how to create a workflow.
