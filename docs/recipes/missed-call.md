# Send an SMS when you miss someone's call

Sometimes we are not at our desk when someone calls us, or we are speaking to another customer. In these moments, we want to reassure customers that we will get back in touch as soon as we can. 

This automation template responds to any missed call with a simple SMS message that is sent to the person who called. 

!!! hint "Delivery of SMS is not guaranteed"
    Please bear in mind that only phone numbers capable of receiving SMS will receive a response. If you miss a call from someone who called from a non-SMS-enabled phone, then they are unlikely to get your auto-reply. 

!!! warning "Be aware of consent"
    Don't forget, sending an SMS message to someone who has not provided consent is not permitted. This recipe sends an SMS auto-reply for every missed call, whether or not the recipient has provided that consent.
