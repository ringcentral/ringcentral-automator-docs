# Acknowledge reciept of an opt-out or opt-in request via SMS

!!! warning "**Opt-in and opt-out auto-replies is now supported in our core product**"
    This recipe is for demonstration purposes only and is meant to illustrate a way of implementing auto-responses to specific keywords. If you are in need of this specific feature we strongly recommend you setup your RingCentral account accordingly. 

This automation is a good demonstration of how you can setup Automator to acknowledge the reciept of messages that contain specific keywords. It models the use case of sending SMS auto-replies in response to receiving specific commands or keywords. In addition, it demonstrates how to augment a contact record in RingCentral with a note to keep a record of the received correspondence. 

Once you install the recipe, if you wish to customize the keywords this automation will respond to then edit the appropriate conditional elements relating to keywords in the advanced automation. 

As a final reminder, RingCentral does not recommend using the recipe as-is. SMS opt-in and opt-out auto-responses are managed within our core product. Using this automation will result in duplicated messages being sent and could increase your costs.
