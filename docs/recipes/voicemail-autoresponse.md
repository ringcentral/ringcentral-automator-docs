# Send an SMS to someone who just left you a voicemail

This automation sends an SMS to someone who just called and left you a voicemail. This is a good way to notify them promptly that you received their voicemail and will respond shortly. 

!!! hint "Delivery of SMS is not guaranteed"
    Please bear in mind that only phone numbers capable of receiving SMS will receive a response. If you miss a call from someone who called from a non-SMS-enabled phone, then they are unlikely to get your auto-reply. 

!!! warning "Be aware of consent"
    Don't forget, sending an SMS message to someone who has not provided consent is not permitted. This recipe sends an SMS auto-reply for every missed call, whether or not the recipient has provided that consent.
